Putin backs state grab for Yukos Russia 's president has defended the purchase of Yukos ' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft , saying it followed free market principles . 
Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met . 
Rosneft bought 100 % of Baikal Finance Group , in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's booming oil industry . 
Rosneft will now control about 16 % of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's total crude oil output . 
Yukos share jumped in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> , climbing as much as 50 % before being suspended . 
Rosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom , the world 's biggest gas company , a move that will see Gazprom return to majority state-ownership . 
Baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukos 's main production division at a forced auction on Sunday . 
" Everything was done by market methods , '' Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> . 
Shedding some light on the Kremlin 's motivation , Mr Putin referred to a period of so-called " cowboy capitalism '' that followed the collapse of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> . 
He said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery , including law breaking , by people seeking to acquire valuable state property . 
" Now the state , using market methods , is safeguarding its interests . 
I think this is quite normal , '' the Russian president said . 
A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a " balanced , national energy corporation . '' 
The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos , one of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 's biggest companies to the brink of collapse . 
The Russian government put Yukos 's Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $ 27bn -LRB- # 14bn -RRB- bill for back taxes and fines . 
Analysts say that Yukos 's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> are probably what caused this week 's cloak-and-dagger dealings . 
Gazprom , the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas , was banned from taking part in the auction by a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> court injunction . 
By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines , analysts said . 
" You can not sue the Russian government , '' said Eric Kraus , a strategist at <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> 's Sovlink Securities . 
" The Russian government has sovereign immunity . '' 
" The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas . '' 
Even so , analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go . 
The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday 's auction . 
It has said it will be seeking damages of $ 20bn . 
The claim was made at the latest hearing in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> bankruptcy court in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , where Yukos , had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . 
If found in contempt of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> court order blocking the auction , Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized . 
Yukos ' lawyers had also been expected to try to have Baikal 's assets frozen . 
Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> law which has worldwide jurisdiction . 
Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned .
