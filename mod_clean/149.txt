Saab to build Cadillacs in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> General Motors , the world 's largest car maker , has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> . 
The car , unveiled at the <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> motor show , is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market . 
It will not be sold in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster . 
As part of its efforts to make the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> marque appeal to European drivers , the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine . 
GM 's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory 's closure . 
The factory in <LOCATION>Trollhaettan</LOCATION> has been at the centre of rumours about GM 's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations . 
But the group 's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group 's Opel workers in <LOCATION>Ruesselsheim</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> . 
They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM 's cuts . 
Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> , since it reflects Saab 's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market . 
For years , Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW , Mercedes and Jaguar . 
The segment 's leaders do not agree . 
GM 's plans to build the American marque in <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers . 
In the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge . 
Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> . 
Other luxury car makers , most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus , have enjoyed tremendous success in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> without managing to make significant inroads in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> . 
There , German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market . 
Bringing Cadillac production to <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory , which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year . 
That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations , and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $ 200m -LRB- # 104m ; 151m euros -RRB- from $ 500m the previous year . 
Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations , GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs , Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> - and now Cadillacs on the same framework , and by allowing the different brands to share parts . 
Another way to further reduce Saab 's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car . 
Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> dollar , which is making Saabs more expensive to <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> consumers . 
But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward . 
" We know that in five years the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> dollar will be stronger than it is today , '' the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News . 
The current trend towards <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> production was " stupid '' , he said . 
In a separate announcement , GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models . 
It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries , inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours . 
It follows a similar initiative by GM in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> . 
GM said it wanted to change " customers ' perceptions '' about Opel and Vauxhall cars , showing them that the quality had improved in recent years .
