Short attacks <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> over tsunami aid Former Cabinet minister Clare Short has criticised the US-led tsunami aid coalition , saying the UN should be leading efforts . 
President Bush has announced that an alliance of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> will co-ordinate a humanitarian drive . 
But Ms Short said the effect of the parallel coalition would be to undermine the UN . 
She said only the UN had the " moral authority '' to lead the relief work . 
Ms Short resigned as international development secretary over the <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> war . 
" I think this initiative from <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> to set up four countries claiming to co-ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the UN when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up , '' she said . 
" Only really the UN can do that job , '' she told BBC Radio Four 's PM programme . 
" It is the only body that has the moral authority . 
But it can only do it well if it is backed up by the authority of the great powers . '' 
Ms Short said the countries involved could not boast good records on their response to major disasters . 
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> was " very bad at coordinating with anyone '' and <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> had its own problems , Ms Short said . 
" I do n't know what that is about but it sounds very much , I am afraid , like the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the UN system , '' she added .
