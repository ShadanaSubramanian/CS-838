<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gives foreign firms extra time Foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stock market watchdog . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 July 2006 . 
Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden . 
The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , part of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom . 
Section 404 of the Sox Act , as the legislation is nicknamed , calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> rules . 
Big <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> firms already have to meet the requirements , but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stock markets originally had until the middle of this year . 
Over the past few months , delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC 's <LOCATION>Washington DC</LOCATION> headquarters to protest . 
They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some , particularly the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> 's CBI , warned that companies would choose to let their <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> listings drop rather than get in line with section 404 . 
The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday , just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced . 
`` I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC , '' CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC 's Today programme . 
`` They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies , who have reminded <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> what globalisation really means : that they ca n't make these rules in isolation . '' 
The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries . 
The European Union , in particular , was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005 , it noted . 
`` I do n't underestimate the effort -LRB- compliance -RRB- will require ... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls , '' said Donald Nicolaisen , the SEC 's chief accountant .
