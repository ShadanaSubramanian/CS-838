EU-US seeking deal on air dispute The EU and US</LOCATION> have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers , EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has announced . 
Both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by European aircraft maker Airbus and its US</LOCATION> rival Boeing , Mr Mandelson said . 
Airbus and Boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies . 
Mr Mandelson said the EU and US</LOCATION> hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the World Trade Organisation -LRB- WTO -RRB- . 
`` With this agreement the EU and US</LOCATION> have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them , '' Mr Mandelson said . 
`` I hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft . '' 
Last year , the US</LOCATION> terminated an agreement with the EU , reached in 1992 , which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers . 
The US</LOCATION> filed a complaint against Brussels</LOCATION> with the WTO over state aid to Airbus , prompting a retaliatory EU complaint over US</LOCATION> support for Boeing . 
However , both sides agreed to suspend their requests for WTO arbitration at the beginning of December , to allow bilateral talks to continue . 
EADS and BAE Systems , the European defence and aerospace firms which own Airbus , welcomed Mr Mandelson 's announcement . 
`` It has always been preferable that any differences between the US</LOCATION> and Europe</LOCATION> on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse , '' the companies said in a joint statement . 
Separately , the world 's largest package delivery company , UPS , said it had placed an order for 10 Airbus A380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets , with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft . 
The US</LOCATION> company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth , and would begin receiving deliveries of the A380s from 2009 . 
However , UPS said it was cutting a previous order for smaller Airbus A300s from 90 planes to 53 . 
So far , Airbus has delivered 40 A300s to UPS . 
Airbus overtook Boeing as the world 's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in 2003 .
