Lesotho</LOCATION> textile workers lose jobs Six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in Lesotho</LOCATION> , leaving 6,650 garment workers jobless , union officers told the AP news agency . 
Factory Workers Union secretary general Billy Macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas . 
The quotas for developing nations , ended on 1 January , gave them a set share of the rich countries ' markets . 
They also limited the amount countries like China</LOCATION> could export to the big markets of the United</LOCATION> States</LOCATION> and EU . 
`` We understand that some -LRB- owners -RRB- ... were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US</LOCATION> dollar , and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United</LOCATION> States</LOCATION> , '' Mr Macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital , Maseru</LOCATION> . 
Lesotho</LOCATION> 's currency , the maloti , is fixed to the rand . 
`` But we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the World Trade Organization . '' 
He said the six factories were Leisure Garments , Modern Garments , Precious Six Garments , TW Garments , Lesotho Hats and Vogue Landmark . 
The owners - two from Taiwan</LOCATION> , two from China</LOCATION> , one from Mauritius</LOCATION> and one from Malaysia</LOCATION> - left over the December holiday period without informing or paying their employees , he said . 
Union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho</LOCATION> , Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> , and Bangaldesh</LOCATION> could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted . 
In the mountainous country surrounded by South</LOCATION> Africa</LOCATION> , it is feared as many as 50,000 textile workers could lose their jobs , and Mr Mafeca said he expected more companies to leave . 
The assistance of a US</LOCATION> law had given Lesotho</LOCATION> 's textiles duty-free access to North American markets . 
The African Growth and Opportunity Act -LRB- AGOA -RRB- , gave sub-Saharan countries preferential access to the US</LOCATION> market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods . 
A Lesotho</LOCATION> government news briefing is expected on Wednesday .
