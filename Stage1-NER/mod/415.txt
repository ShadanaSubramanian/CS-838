UK</LOCATION> house prices dip in November UK</LOCATION> house prices dipped slightly in November , the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister -LRB- ODPM -RRB- has said . 
The average house price fell marginally to # 180,226 , from # 180,444 in October . 
Recent evidence has suggested that the UK</LOCATION> housing market is slowing after interest rate increases , and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005 . 
But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market , annual house price inflation is still strong , up 13.8 % in the year to November . 
Economists , however , forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months . 
`` Overall , the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data , '' said Mark Miller , at HBOS Treasury Services . 
`` The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator . '' 
The figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK</LOCATION> has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade . 
The Halifax</LOCATION> , meanwhile , said last week that house prices increased by 1.1 % in December - the first monthly rise since September . 
The UK</LOCATION> 's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1 % over the whole of 2004 , but by only 2.8 % in the second half of the year . 
It is predicting a 2 % fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years . 
The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats . 
It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1 % in the same period in 2003 . 
The ODPM data showed the average house price was # 192,713 in England</LOCATION> ; # 139,544 in Wales</LOCATION> ; # 116,542 in Scotland</LOCATION> , and # 111,314 in Northern</LOCATION> Ireland</LOCATION> . 
All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern</LOCATION> Ireland</LOCATION> and the West</LOCATION> Midlands</LOCATION> , where the rate was unchanged , the ODPM said . 
The North</LOCATION> East</LOCATION> showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2 % , followed by Yorkshire</LOCATION> and the Humber on 21.7 % , and the North West on 21.1 % . 
The East</LOCATION> Midlands</LOCATION> , the West</LOCATION> Midlands</LOCATION> and the South</LOCATION> West</LOCATION> all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15 % . 
In London</LOCATION> , the area with the highest average house price at # 262,825 , annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1 % from 7 % the previous month .
