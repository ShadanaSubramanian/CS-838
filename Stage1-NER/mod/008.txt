He also called for reform of the United Nations , the World Bank and the IMF . 
Palaniappan Chidambaram , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's finance minister , argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order , given <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's integration into the global economy . 
He said the issue is not globalisation but `` the terms of engagement in globalisation . '' 
Mr Chidambaram is attending the G7 meeting as part of the G20 group of nations , which account for two thirds of the world 's population . 
At a conference on developing enterprise hosted by <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> finance minister Gordon Brown on Friday , he said that he was in favour of floating exchange rates because they help countries cope with economic shocks .

`` Some countries have tried to use fixed exchange rates . 
I do not wish to make any judgements , '' Mr Chidambaram said .
