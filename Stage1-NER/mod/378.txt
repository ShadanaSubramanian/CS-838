Ukraine</LOCATION> strikes Turkmen gas deal Ukraine</LOCATION> has agreed to pay 30 % more for natural gas supplied by Turkmenistan</LOCATION> . 
The deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan</LOCATION> cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy . 
Supplies from Turkmenistan</LOCATION> account for 45 % of all natural gas imported by Ukraine</LOCATION> , which has large coal deposits but no gas fields . 
Turkmenistan</LOCATION> is also trying to strike a similar deal with Russia</LOCATION> , which is not so dependent on its gas . 
Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov , who signed the contract , said the Turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $ 2 per 1,000 cubic metres , bringing it down to $ 58 . 
But the new price is still $ 14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004 . 
The head of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftohaz company , Yury Boyko , said he was `` fully happy '' with the deal . 
On Friday , Turkmenistan</LOCATION> acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to Ukraine</LOCATION> in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head . 
Mr Niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to Russia</LOCATION> . 
Analysts say thay may not happen as Russia</LOCATION> , the world 's leading gas producer , needs the cheap Turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned Gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in Siberia</LOCATION> . 
Turkmenistan</LOCATION> is the second-largest gas producer in the world .
