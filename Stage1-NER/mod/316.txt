Euronext ` poised to make LSE bid ' Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange , <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> media reports say . 
Last week , the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about # 1.35 bn . 
The LSE , which saw its shares rise 25 % , said the bid undervalued the business . 
Euronext - formed after the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer . 
The LSE , <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's biggest stock market , is a key prize , listing stocks with a total capitalisation of # 1.4 trillion . 
Euronext already has a presence in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe . 
Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet , in which Euronext has a quarter stake . 
Euronext , which also operates an exchange in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> , last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors . 
It is also working with Morgan Stanley . 
Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week , Werner Seifert , chief executive of the <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> -based exchange , may well come back with an improved offer . 
It has long wanted to link up with <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000 . 
Responding to the LSE 's rebuff , Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than # 3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits , and that it still hoped to make a cash bid . 
Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued , but that it had `` been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented '' . 
However , it has indicated it is open for further talks . 
Meanwhile , German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert 's negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange . 
While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , the mayor of <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs . 
Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war .
