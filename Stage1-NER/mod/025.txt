Yukos loses <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> bankruptcy battle A judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> . 
Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its <LOCATION>Yugansk</LOCATION> division by the Russian authorities . 
The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of <LOCATION>Yugansk</LOCATION> , which Yukos claims was illegally sold . 
Separately , former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion . 
Mr Khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities . 
`` I pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees , '' he told a Russian court . 
<LOCATION>Yugansk</LOCATION> was auctioned to help pay off $ 27.5 bn -LRB- # 14.5 bn -RRB- in unpaid taxes . 
It was bought for $ 9.4 bn by a previously-unknown group , which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft . 
<LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> presence to establish <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> jurisdiction . 
`` The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , '' Judge Clark said in her ruling . 
`` Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government . '' 
Yukos had argued that a <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its <LOCATION>Yugansk</LOCATION> unit was sold , since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in <LOCATION>Houston</LOCATION> . 
Yukos claimed it sought help in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection . 
<LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> courts . 
In her ruling , the judge acknowledged that `` it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> law '' . 
But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction . 
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> court 's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft , a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft . 
Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of <LOCATION>Yugansk</LOCATION> remained unclear . 
Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling . 
However , it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues . 
`` We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple , '' said chief executive Steven Theede . 
`` Our assets were illegally seized . 
We want them back or damages paid . ''
