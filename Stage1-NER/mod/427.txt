Chinese exports rise 25 % in 2004 Exports from China</LOCATION> leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth . 
The spurt put China</LOCATION> 's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high . 
It may also increase pressure on China</LOCATION> to relax the peg joining its currency , the yuan , with the weakening dollar . 
The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China</LOCATION> 's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9 % in 2004 for the second year in a row . 
State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7 % rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan -LRB- $ 311bn ; # 165bn -RRB- . 
According to the Ministry of Commerce , China</LOCATION> 's exports totalled $ 63.8 bn in December , taking the annual total up 35.4 % to $ 593.4 bn . 
With imports rising a similar amount , the deficit rose to $ 43.4 bn . 
The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004 , according to Mr Xie . 
China</LOCATION> 's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United</LOCATION> States</LOCATION> soar even further and made trade with China</LOCATION> a sensitive political issue in Washington</LOCATION> . 
The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US</LOCATION> lawmakers for job losses at home . 
A US</LOCATION> report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003 . 
The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period , said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission , moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors . 
The US</LOCATION> 's overall trade deficit with China</LOCATION> was $ 124bn in 2003 , and is expected to rise to about $ 150bn for 2004 .
