The world 's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its European business , and weak US</LOCATION> sales .

GM , whose brands include Buick , Cadillac and Chevrolet in the US</LOCATION> and Opel , Saab and Vauxhall in Europe</LOCATION> , is due to reveal 2004 earnings on 19 January . 
It said it would deliver a shareholder payout of $ 6.0 - $ 6.5 per share this year , as promised , but that next year 's earnings per share would be lower , at between $ 4.0 - $ 5.0 . 
`` We 're following a roadmap that we believe will deliver strong results , '' said GM chief executive Rick Waggoner . 
GM said it was expecting `` reduced financial losses '' in Europe</LOCATION> in 2005 . 
It is in the midst of cutting 12,000 jobs - one fifth of the European total - in a bid to cut costs . 
The biggest job losses are in Germany</LOCATION> . 
Its vehicle businesses have gained market share in three out of four regions in 2004 , achieving record profitability in Asia</LOCATION> Pacific</LOCATION> and returning to profit in Latin</LOCATION> America</LOCATION> , the Middle</LOCATION> East</LOCATION> and Africa</LOCATION> . 
The car maker has diversified into financial services , and is extending the reach of General Motors Acceptance Corp -LRB- GMAC -RRB- , which has said it may enter the home loans market .
