Indonesia</LOCATION> ` declines debt freeze ' Indonesia</LOCATION> no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors , Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said . 
Indonesia</LOCATION> , which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer , owes the Paris Club about $ 48bn -LRB- # 25.5 bn -RRB- . 
Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $ 1.7 bn donors ' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary . 
This aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $ 3.4 bn package . 
Most of this ` normal aid ' would be used to finance the country 's budget deficit . 
The Indonesian Economics Minister explained that the money - $ 1.2 bn in grants and $ 500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of Aceh</LOCATION> province , which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 December . 
Nevertheless , one of Mr Bakrie 's deputies , Mahendra Siregar , told AFP news agency that Indonesia</LOCATION> was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments . 
`` What is true is that we are still discussing ... the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium . 
That 's how far we are at this stage , '' said Mr Siregar . 
The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $ 5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian</LOCATION> Ocean</LOCATION> tsunami . 
Indonesia</LOCATION> , Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> and the Seychelles</LOCATION> accepted the Paris Club offer , which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little . 
Thailand</LOCATION> and India</LOCATION> have however declined the offer , with Thailand</LOCATION> prefering to keep up with its payments while India</LOCATION> said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid . 
Putting off payments may lower a country 's rating among financial organisations , making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future , analysts said . 
Separately , the Indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money . 
Welfare Minister Alwi Shihab told AP news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations .
