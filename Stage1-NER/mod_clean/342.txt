Honda wins <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> copyright ruling <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 's Honda has won a copyright case in <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , further evidence that <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights . 
A court ruled that Chongqing Lifan Industry Group must stop selling Honda brand motorbikes and said it must pay 1.47 m yuan -LRB- $ 177,600 -RRB- in compensation . 
Internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> 's plans for developing its economy , analysts said . 
<LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down . 
Chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs . 
Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem , foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small . 
Still , recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing . 
Earlier this week <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail . 
And on Tuesday , Paws Incorporated - the owner of the rights to Garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright .

And it is growing . 
Between 1998 and 2002 , the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU 's external borders increased by more than 800 % , it said . 
Last month the EU said it will start monitoring <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to ensure they are going after pirated goods . 
Other countries on the EU 's hit list include <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> .
