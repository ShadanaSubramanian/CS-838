Barclays profits hit record level Barclays , the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> 's third-biggest bank , has seen annual pre-tax profits climb to record levels boosted by a sharp rise in business at its investment arm . 
Profits for the year to 31 December rose 20 % to # 4.6 bn -LRB- $ 8.6 bn -RRB- . 
Barclays ' chief John Varley said the bank had " caught the winds '' of a very strong world economy . 
Earnings at Barclays Capital investment bank rose 25 % to # 1.04 bn , but investment in branch operations held back growth in its UK</LOCATION> retail business . 
The group is the first of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 's five big banks to report 2004 results . 
According to analysts ' forecasts , HSBC , the biggest <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bank by stock market valuation , will report profits of # 9.4 bn later this month . 
Barclays results were in line with market expectations . 
Its Global Investors wing made # 347m , an 82 % jump on 2003 figures . 
Profits at Barclaycard rose by 5 % to # 801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base . 
The bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1 % fall in profits in its <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> retail division to # 1.13 bn . 
" The outlook for 2005 is good as a result of balance sheet growth and investments made in 2004 , '' Mr Varley said . 
Barclays cautioned that growth this year may be slower than in 2004 on the back of softer <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> and Chinese economies and the impact of interest rate rises on household spending in the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> . 
It added its bid to acquire a controlling stake in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> 's leading retail bank Absa , was being considered by regulatory authorities . 
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 , Mr Varley declined to be drawn on reports that Barclays had held merger talks with <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> bank Wells Fargo . 
A tie-up between Barclays and California-based Wells Fargo would create the world 's fourth biggest bank , valued at $ 180bn . 
At 1405 GMT , shares in Barclays were trading down 0.67 % at 590 pence . 
" The headline numbers are in line , but the story is costs , '' said analyst Alex Potter at Lehman Brothers . 
" They are a bit more aggressive than we had expected . 
The cost overshoot is not in Barclays Capital but in the UK bank . ''
