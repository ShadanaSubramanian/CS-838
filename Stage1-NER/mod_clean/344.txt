Battered dollar hits another low The dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy . 
The greenback hit $ 1.3516 in thin <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> trade , before rallying to $ 1.3509 . 
The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $ 1.20 , amid continuing worries over the levels of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> trade and budget deficits . 
Meanwhile , <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> 's finance minister has said the world faced " economic catastrophe '' unless the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> worked with <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> on currency controls . 
Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of G7 countries in February . 
Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to strengthen the dollar , saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies . 
" It 's absolutely essential that at the meeting of the G7 our American friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level , '' said Mr Gaymard . 
Thursday 's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> had fallen 12 % in November - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity . 
Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy - grew just 0.2 % last month . 
The figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8 % rise in October . 
The official <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters . 
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from " abnormal and dangerous heights '' set in 2002 . 
The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> says it will let market forces determine the dollar 's strength rather than intervene directly . 
Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency . 
But while some observers said the quiet trade on Thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market , most agree the underlying trend remains downwards . 
The dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further , albeit less dramatic weakening , in 2005 . 
" I can see it finishing the year around $ 1.35 and we can see that it 's going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005 , finishing the year around $ 1.40 , '' said Adrian Hughes , currency strategist with HSBC in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> .
