The value of trade in April-July rose to $ 186.3 m -LRB- # 97m -RRB- from $ 64.4 m in the same period in 2003 , the Indian Government said . 
Nonethless , the figures represent less than 1 % of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's overall exports . 
But business is expected to be boosted further from 2006 when the South Asian Free Trade Area Agreement starts . 
Both countries eased travel and other restrictions as part of the peace process aimed at ending nearly six decades of hostilities . 
Sugar , plastics , pharmaceutical products and tea are among the major exports from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to its neighbour , while firms in Pakistani have been selling fabrics , fruit and spices . 
" If the positive trend continues , two-way trade could well cross half a billion dollars this fiscal year , '' <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's federal commerce Minister Kamal Nath said . 
According to official data , the value of <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> 's overall exports in the current fiscal year is expected to reach more than $ 60bn , while in <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> 's case it is set to hit more than $ 12bn . 
Meanwhile , the Indian Government said the prospects for the country 's booming economy remained " very bright '' despite a " temporary aberration '' this year . 
Its mid-year economic review forecasts growth of 6-6 .5 % in 2004 , compared with 8.2 % in 2003 . 
Higher oil prices , the level of tax collections , and an unfavourable monsoon season affecting the farm sector had hurt the economy in April-September , it said .
