Indonesians face fuel price rise <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> 's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30 % . 
Millions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking , and prices have been heavily subsidised for years . 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono 's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor . 
But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help . 
Millions of people were left homeless in <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> Aceh</LOCATION> 's region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December . 
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices , but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down . 
It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah -LRB- $ 6.58 bn ; # 3.5 bn -RRB- on fuel subsidies in 2004 , a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah . 
Since President Yudhoyono 's government came to power in October , it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies . 
" The -LRB- January to March -RRB- quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices , '' said Sri Mulyani Indrawati , State Minister for National Development Planning . 
" We are still considering if a 30 % hike is suitable at the moment . 
The sooner the better for the state budget . '' 
The BBC 's correspondent in <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> , Rachel Harvey , told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise . 
" The big question is whether they go for one big , short , sharp shock and raise prices between 20 % and 30 % or whether they try to stagger it , '' she said . 
<LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> 's previous government , led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri , also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003 , but was forced to back down in the face of public protests .
