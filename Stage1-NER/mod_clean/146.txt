Why few targets are better than many The economic targets set out at the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> leapfrog its way past the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to become the world 's leading economy by 2010 . 
But the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> targets are about much more than just economic prestige . 
For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> does n't become a global economic laggard . 
They are also about ensuring <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , as well as with the economic might of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> . 
That 's why there was a tone of urgency in the report , out on Wednesday , by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok . 
Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> targets , five years on from their inception . 
His conclusion was simple : too many of the targets will be seriously missed . 
<LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> risks becoming a " synonym for missed objectives and failed promises '' , his report said . 
" The status quo is not an option . '' 
At risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> has built , it said . 
The report comes at a time when <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's competitive position is waning . 
The EU 's economic growth rate is projected to be 2 % this year and 2.4 % next . 
While there has been growth in overall employment rates in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , productivity lags behind that of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> . 
But meeting the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far . 
That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years . 
As Mr Kok 's report noted : " The ink had scarcely dried on the -LSB- <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> -RSB- agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded . '' 
" The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit . '' 
The circumstances were n't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> in 2000 . 
Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development , money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called " knowledge-based economy '' . 
" The -LSB- <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> -RSB- vision is a compelling one , but in order to do it society has to change , '' said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council , a <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> -based citizen action group . 
" What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change . 
You find trade unions fighting change . 
But also the employers ' associations . 
" Even though they tell you they 're in favour of change , many are actually pushing for less competition , more subsidy and less free market activity . '' 
But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> five years ago . 
Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> case , they covered too much , according to the Wim report . 
Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion , and even safety at sea . 
The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised . 
" <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> is about everything and thus about nothing , '' the Kok report said . 
" Everybody is responsible and thus no one . '' 
That 's why the Kok report recommends that the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators , with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth . 
It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they 're taking towards meeting the targets , effectively " naming , shaming and faming '' . 
" Rhetoric and delivery do n't necessarily go hand in hand , '' Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report . 
" We do n't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another . '' 
On one point Mr Kok was very clear : The European Union should not try to emulate the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> economy . 
The European economic and social model needs to change , but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth . 
In that sense , the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> agenda is sailing into unchartered waters . 
The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth . 
" It 's very ambitious , '' said John Palmer , political director at the European Policy Centre , a Brussels-based think-tank . 
" This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do . 
It 's going to require quite new and innovative policies . '' 
But some analysts believe that the Kok report does n't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> targets a reality . 
For example , it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce . 
But it does n't say how companies should be convinced to do this . 
It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission , Jose Manuel Barroso , to adopt Mr Kok 's recommendations and press them on EU governments . 
Mr Barroso has said that the EU 's competitiveness will be his top priority . 
He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> 's success in meeting the <LOCATION>Lisbon</LOCATION> agenda .
