<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> firm pulls out of <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> A <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> 's transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts , Pentagon officials have said . 
Contrack International , of <LOCATION>Arlington</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes . 
Its withdrawal from the $ 325m -LRB- # 170m -RRB- contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date . 
Contrack said " the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner '' . 
But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
" Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts , are actively working in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country , '' it said in a statement . 
The Pentagon 's Project and Contract Office -LRB- PCO -RRB- in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> said it had taken over Contrack 's management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects . 
<LOCATION>US</LOCATION> firms and their workers have been targets of attacks , and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
Of the $ 18.4 bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress , less than $ 2bn has been spent . 
Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack 's withdrawal from the transportation contract was a " mutually agreed-to separation '' and did not indicate a movement by <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> companies to leave <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> . 
" Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others , '' he added . 
" Where we can get the work done , good things are happening . ''
