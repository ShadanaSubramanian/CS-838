Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets India</LOCATION> 's biggest oil exploration firm , Oil & Natural Gas Corp -LRB- ONGC -RRB- , says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos . 
`` We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia</LOCATION> , '' said ONGC chairman Subir Raha . 
Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15 % of Yukos ' former key oil production unit for $ 2bn -LRB- # 1bn -RRB- . 
Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill . 
It was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> -LRB- Yugansk</LOCATION> -RRB- last month after being hit with a bill of $ 27bn in unpaid taxes and fines . 
State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm . 
Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC 's plans during a trip to Moscow</LOCATION> last year , and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin 's recent visit to New</LOCATION> Delhi</LOCATION> . 
`` It would make great sense for us to build on that , '' said Mr Aiyar . 
India</LOCATION> 's oil production has stagnated over recent years , and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies . 
India</LOCATION> imports about 70 % of its total oil consumption . 
At the same time , India</LOCATION> 's economy is booming and the country 's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide . 
India</LOCATION> produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- , little changed since the start of the 1990s , according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood . 
Consumption , meanwhile , has jumped to 2.4 million bpd , compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973 . 
`` For countries to develop , they have to have access to energy , '' said John Westwood , managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood . 
India</LOCATION> is a `` dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil '' . 
By buying into Yugansk</LOCATION> , ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf</LOCATION> states for oil imports , Mr Westwood explained , especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India</LOCATION> are slim . 
`` We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline , '' Mr Westwood said . 
`` By 2020 , production may only be at half of today 's levels . '' 
ONGC , which is majority-owned by the Indian state , already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam</LOCATION> , Sudan</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> . 
The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia</LOCATION> 's Siberian coast . 
ONGC is , however , not the only firm interested in Yugansk</LOCATION> . 
Chinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor , while on Thursday , Italy</LOCATION> refused to rule out an interest . 
ONGC 's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world 's biggest oil producers brought to its knees . 
The dispute is partly driven by President Putin 's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion . 
Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US</LOCATION> . 
Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk</LOCATION> . 
On Thursday , a US</LOCATION> court said it will hear arguments for Yukos ' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February . 
Should that happen , Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets , analysts said .
