Deutsche attacks Yukos case German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US</LOCATION> . 
In a court filing on Tuesday , it said the Russian oil giant has few Texas</LOCATION> ties beyond bank accounts and a Texas-based finance chief . 
Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset . 
It had wanted to help fund Gazprom 's plans for a $ 10bn -LRB- # 5.18 bn -RRB- bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> . 
Deutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal , which could not be carried out because US</LOCATION> chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin 's auction of Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> on 19 December illegal under US</LOCATION> law . 
But the US</LOCATION> bankruptcy court judge in Texas</LOCATION> granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part . 
Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> will ultimately end up with Gazprom . 
The winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm , Baikal Finance Group , which was snapped up days later by Rosneft , a Russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with Gazprom . 
The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> . 
Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas</LOCATION> in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government , which was in a tax dispute with Yukos . 
`` This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case , '' Deutsche Bank said in its court filing . 
Mike Lake , a spokesman for Yukos ' lawyers , said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action . 
Yukos is confident of its right to US</LOCATION> bankruptcy protection , and `` we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again , '' he said . 
Yukos has said it intends to seek $ 20bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> once the sale finally goes through . 
In its filing , Deutsche Bank said Houston</LOCATION> was `` a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations . '' 
It also said the US</LOCATION> bankruptcy court should not become involved in `` a tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens '' . 
It suggested the European Court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between Russia</LOCATION> and Yukos . 
The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 January . 
Analysts believe the tax dispute between the Russian government and Yukos is partly driven by Russian president Vladimir Putin 's hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khordokovsky . 
Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail , and on trial for fraud and tax evasion .
