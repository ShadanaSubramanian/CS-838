<LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> deal ` to help world peace ' A deal bringing <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> a step closer to EU membership is of `` fundamental importance '' to the peace and security of the world , Tony Blair has said . 
The deal , struck at the European Council last week , also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were `` wrong '' , Mr Blair said . 
It represented the achievement of an `` historic British objective '' , he added . 
Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was `` anti-Islamic '' . 
<LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> 's involvement with the EU would provide an `` invaluable bridge '' between <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the rest of the world , Mr Howard added . 
But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> . 
Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea . 
He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records . 
The deal to open formal talks with <LOCATION>Ankara</LOCATION> came despite an EU demand for <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> to recognise <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> . 
It was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership . 
The internationally recognised southern part of <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> is an EU member , but <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> , which occupies northern <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> , had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country , calling the issue a `` red line '' . 
It could take up to 15 years before <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> is able to join , and entry can not be guaranteed . 
If it joins , <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens . 
The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> in April 2005 . 
However , talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> .
