` Post-Christmas lull ' in lending UK</LOCATION> mortgage lending showed a `` post-Christmas lull '' in January , indicating a slowing housing market , lenders have said . 
Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders -LRB- CML -RRB- and Building Society Association -LRB- BSA -RRB- said lending was down sharply . 
The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at # 17.9 bn , compared with # 21.8 bn in January last year . 
The BSA said mortgage approvals - loans approved but not yet made - were # 2bn , down from # 2.6 bn in January 2004 . 
At the same time , the British Bankers ' Association -LRB- BBA -RRB- said lending was `` weaker '' . 
Overall , the BBA said mortgage lending rose by # 4bn in January , a far smaller increase than the # 5.1 bn seen in December . 
This was a return to the `` weaker pattern '' of lending seen in the last months of 2004 , the BBA added . 
However , it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking . 
The CML said lending for house purchases and gross mortgage lending were 29 % and 18 % lower year-on-year respectively . 
`` These figures show beyond doubt the recent slowdown in the housing market , '' Peter Williams , CML deputy director , said .
