Asia</LOCATION> quake increases poverty risk Nearly two million people across Asia</LOCATION> could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian</LOCATION> Ocean</LOCATION> tsunami , the Asian Development Bank -LRB- ADB -RRB- has said . 
In its first overview of the disaster , the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage . 
But the blow to many low-income people could be `` enormous '' . 
The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries . 
The move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas , though so far only Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> , Indonesia</LOCATION> and the Seychelles</LOCATION> have indicated that they will take it up . 
Other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks . 
`` Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster , '' said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali . 
Donor nations have promised to give $ 717m -LRB- # 379m -RRB- in disaster relief over the next six months , according to the United Nations . 
Mr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered , saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on `` concerns over sanitation and health conditions , and other basic needs '' being `` properly and quickly addressed '' . 
There are 1.9 billion people in Asia</LOCATION> living on less than $ 2 a day . 
The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them , while in India</LOCATION> just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty . 
A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives</LOCATION> are also facing poverty . 
In the Maldives</LOCATION> , where 43 % of the population already lives on less than $ 2 a day , this could rise to half . 
Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> and the Maldives</LOCATION> are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami . 
Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> 's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $ 3bn . 
A government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB , World Bank and Japanese aid agencies on Wednesday , and promised to publish the plan within 10 days . 
Indonesia</LOCATION> , Malaysia</LOCATION> , Thailand</LOCATION> and India</LOCATION> have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years , which should cushion them against reconstruction costs . 
Although Indonesia</LOCATION> 's northern province of Aceh</LOCATION> suffered the worst death toll , the region 's oil and natural gas production facilities `` have survived intact '' , the report said . 
However , it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people 's livelihoods in Aceh</LOCATION> because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater . 
`` This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering . 
But the economies of the affected countries except Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> and the Maldives</LOCATION> should emerge with minimal damage , '' the ADB report said . 
Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts , thereby creating jobs . 
At a meeting in Thailand</LOCATION> , ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country 's `` own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements '' . 
Thailand</LOCATION> has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze , while India</LOCATION> has also rejected international aid , saying it can cope on its own resources . 
Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades , making it more expensive to borrow money in future . 
Indonesia</LOCATION> , however , is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring . 
It is one of the world 's most indebted countries .
