Yukos bankruptcy ` not US</LOCATION> matter ' Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US</LOCATION> court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos , a Houston</LOCATION> court has been told . 
Legal expert William Butler said there was no treaty between the US</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> to recognise the other 's legal rulings . 
That meant Moscow</LOCATION> would not have to adhere to US</LOCATION> rulings in the Yukos case . 
Yukos says a US</LOCATION> court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk</LOCATION> unit was sold , since it has a US</LOCATION> subsidiary and local bank accounts . 
Yukos made its surprise Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Houston</LOCATION> in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk</LOCATION> , its main oil producing unit , by Russian authorities . 
Yugansk</LOCATION> was sold to help pay off a $ 27.5 bn -LRB- # 14.5 bn -RRB- back tax bill . 
It was bought for $ 9.4 bn by a previously unknown group , which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft . 
The US</LOCATION> court 's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft</LOCATION> , a former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft . 
Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in a US</LOCATION> court because Yukos has no assets in the US</LOCATION> , apart from two bank accounts and a house in Houston</LOCATION> owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore . 
Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos . 
It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft</LOCATION> the money to bid for Yugansk</LOCATION> . 
US</LOCATION> bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark , who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk</LOCATION> sale , has said she will rule `` pretty promptly , however I do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday '' . 
Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US</LOCATION> because other forums - Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection . 
It has claimed that Russia</LOCATION> imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk</LOCATION> as part of a campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky , who is facing a 10-year prison term in Russia</LOCATION> for fraud and tax evasion . 
Yukos ' parent company , the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group , is suing Russia</LOCATION> in Europe</LOCATION> for $ 28.3 bn in financial damages . 
The company is also seeking $ 20bn in a separate US</LOCATION> lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk</LOCATION> .
