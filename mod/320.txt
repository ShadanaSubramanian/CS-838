Iraq</LOCATION> and Afghanistan</LOCATION> in WTO talks The World Trade Organisation -LRB- WTO -RRB- is to hold membership talks with both Iraq</LOCATION> and Afghanistan</LOCATION> . 
But Iran</LOCATION> 's bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US</LOCATION> blocked its application for the 21st time . 
The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group , whose purpose is to promote free trade . 
Joining , however , is a lengthy process . 
China</LOCATION> 's admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia</LOCATION> and Saudi</LOCATION> Arabia</LOCATION> have been taking place for 10 years . 
Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country 's goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation . 
Iraq</LOCATION> 's Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move , describing it as significant as November 's decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80 % of the country 's debts . 
Assad Omar , Afghanistan</LOCATION> 's envoy to the United Nations in Geneva</LOCATION> , said accession would contribute to `` regional prosperity and global security '' . 
There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO . 
Prospective members need to enter into negotiations with potential trading countries and change domestic laws to bring them in line with WTO regulations . 
Before the process gets under way , all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries . 
The US</LOCATION> said it could not approve Iran</LOCATION> 's application because it is currently reviewing relations . 
But several nations criticised the approach , and European Union ambassador to the WTO , Carlo Trojan , said Iran</LOCATION> 's application `` must be treated independently of political issues '' .
