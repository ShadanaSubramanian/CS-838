Gaming firm to sell <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> dog tracks

Six <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.

Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gaming division to BLB Investors. <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gaming consortium BLB will pay $339m (£182.5m) for the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions. BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a £308m takeover deal. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.

The sale of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> gaming unit will leave Wembley with its <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> business. This includes greyhound tracks at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>, Belle Vue in <LOCATION>Manchester</LOCATION>, Perry Barr and Hall Green in <LOCATION>Birmingham</LOCATION>, <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Portsmouth</LOCATION>. Analysts have valued the six tracks at between £40m-£50m. The <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> business accounts for about 90% of Wembley's operating profit and consists of operations in <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION>. BLB's purchase of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with <LOCATION>Rhode Island</LOCATION> authorities. Wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. "Whilst the completion of the sale of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders," said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman. Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.
