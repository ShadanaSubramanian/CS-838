Gaming firm to sell UK</LOCATION> dog tracks Six UK</LOCATION> greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group Wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group . 
Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US</LOCATION> gaming division to BLB Investors . 
US</LOCATION> gaming consortium BLB will pay $ 339m -LRB- # 182.5 m -RRB- for the US</LOCATION> unit , although the deal is subject to certain conditions . 
BLB holds a 22 % stake in Wembley</LOCATION> and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a # 308m takeover deal . 
Shares in Wembley</LOCATION> were up 56 pence , or 7.6 % , at 797p by mid-morning . 
The sale of the US</LOCATION> gaming unit will leave Wembley</LOCATION> with its UK</LOCATION> business . 
This includes greyhound tracks at Wimbledon</LOCATION> in London</LOCATION> , Belle Vue in Manchester</LOCATION> , Perry Barr and Hall Green in Birmingham</LOCATION> , Oxford</LOCATION> and Portsmouth</LOCATION> . 
Analysts have valued the six tracks at between # 40m - # 50m . 
The US</LOCATION> business accounts for about 90 % of Wembley 's operating profit and consists of operations in Rhode</LOCATION> Island</LOCATION> and Colorado</LOCATION> . 
BLB 's purchase of the US</LOCATION> unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with Rhode</LOCATION> Island</LOCATION> authorities . 
Wembley said that , once the deal was completed , it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders . 
`` Whilst the completion of the sale of the US</LOCATION> Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions , we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders , '' said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman . 
Wembley sold the English national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations .
