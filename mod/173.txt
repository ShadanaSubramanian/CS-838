Brewers ' profits lose their fizz Heineken and Carlsberg , two of the world 's largest brewers , have reported falling profits after beer sales in western Europe</LOCATION> fell flat . 
Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33 % and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide . 
Danish brewer Carlsberg suffered a 3 % fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs . 
Both are looking to Russia</LOCATION> and China</LOCATION> to provide future growth as western European markets are largely mature . 
Heineken 's net income fell to 537m euros -LRB- $ 701m ; # 371m -RRB- during 2004 , from 798m euro a year ago . 
It blamed weak demand in western Europe</LOCATION> and currency losses . 
It had warned in September that the weakening US</LOCATION> dollar , which has cut the value of foreign sales , would knock 125m euros off its operating profits . 
Despite the dip in profits , Heineken 's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros , up 8.1 % from 9.26 bn euros in 2003 . 
Heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in `` aggressive '' and `` high-impact '' marketing in Europe</LOCATION> and the US</LOCATION> in 2005 . 
Heineken , which also owns the Amstel and Murphy 's stout brands , said it would also seek to cut costs . 
This may involve closing down breweries . 
Heineken increased its dividend payment by 25 % to 40 euro cents , but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit . 
Carlsberg , the world 's fifth-largest brewer , saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4 bn Danish kroner -LRB- 456m euros -RRB- . 
Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries . 
Nevertheless , total sales increased 4 % to 36bn kroner , thanks to strong sales of Carlsberg lager in Russia</LOCATION> and Poland</LOCATION> . 
Carlsberg is more optimistic than Heineken about 2005 , projecting a 15 % rise in net profits for the year . 
However , it also plans to cut 200 jobs in Sweden</LOCATION> , where sales have been hit by demand for cheap , imported brands . 
`` We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe</LOCATION> for a host of economic , social and structural reasons , '' investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg .
