Yukos heading back to US</LOCATION> courts Russian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US</LOCATION> court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival . 
The firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $ 27bn -LRB- # 14bn -RRB- tax bill . 
Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US</LOCATION> , hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit , Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> . 
The unit was however sold for $ 9.4 bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted . 
Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US</LOCATION> bankruptcy law . 
The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets , using all and every legal means . 
The company wants damages of $ 20bn , claiming Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> was sold at less than market value . 
Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions , including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing . 
The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom , the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> . 
Deutsche Bank , which is also an advisor to Gazprom , has called on the US</LOCATION> court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection . 
Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank 's business position , analysts said . 
Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos ' chances in court . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country 's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US</LOCATION> has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings . 
On top of that , the firm only has limited assets in the US</LOCATION> . 
Yukos has won small victories , however , and is bullish about its chances in court . 
`` Do we have an ability to influence what happens ? 
We think we do , '' said Mike Lake , a Yukos spokesman . 
`` The litigation risks are real , '' said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin 's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion .
