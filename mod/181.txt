India</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> in energy talks India</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> are to work together in a series of energy deals , part of a pact which could see India</LOCATION> invest up to $ 20bn in oil and gas projects . 
On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals , to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India</LOCATION> 's ONGC . 
The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by Yukos . 
It is reported to be keen on buying a 15 % stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> . 
The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft . 
Russian media reported that India</LOCATION> and Russia</LOCATION> signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during a meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha , Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India</LOCATION> 's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar . 
The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia</LOCATION> , India</LOCATION> and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil , gas and petrochemicals from Russia</LOCATION> to India</LOCATION> and other countries across Asia</LOCATION> . 
ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin</LOCATION> , in the far east of Russia</LOCATION> , and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia</LOCATION> and the Caspian</LOCATION> Sea</LOCATION> . 
India</LOCATION> is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5 % a year . 
ONGC 's Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year . 
`` At current oil and gas prices , our cash flow situation is good , '' he told Reuters . 
`` What we are saying is - Gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money . 
`` The investment may go up to $ 20bn or more for a period of five years or so . '' 
Russian news agencies reported that India</LOCATION> 's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk</LOCATION> at a meeting on Tuesday . 
ONGC 's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm 's reported interest in the company . 
However , he stressed that ONGC was not interested in a ` loan-for-oil deal ' in connection to Yugansk</LOCATION> , similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China</LOCATION> 's National Petroleum Corporation . 
`` China</LOCATION> 's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries . 
We do not . 
We would like long-term security through equity participation . '' 
It is thought that any decision over Yugansk</LOCATION> will be delayed until a US</LOCATION> court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection . 
Yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk</LOCATION> , auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill . 
It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary .
