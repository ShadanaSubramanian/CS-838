Water firm Suez in Argentina</LOCATION> row A conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas , controlled by France</LOCATION> 's Suez , is casting doubt on the firm 's future . 
The firm , which serves the province of Buenos</LOCATION> Aires</LOCATION> , wants a tariff rise of 60 % to fund water-supply improvements . 
The government has rejected the 60 % rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos -LRB- $ 136m ; # 72.3 m -RRB- in improvements . 
Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for `` free '' . 
Mr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make a contribution `` in the form of a subsidy '' . 
He has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company 's board . 
He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed . 
However , Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and , in practice , this rules out State participation on its board . 
The Planning Minister did n't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession . 
Yet he added that he did n't like to do `` futurology '' . 
But last week , Argentine Economic Minister , Roberto Lavagna , told the French media in Paris</LOCATION> that the government was considering allowing a 16 % increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments . 
Speaking in Buenos</LOCATION> Aires</LOCATION> , Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions . 
He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided . 
Suez owns 40 % of Aguas Argentinas -LRB- 39.9 % -RRB- , while Spain</LOCATION> 's Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01 % . 
Recently , Suez lost a water concession in Bolivia</LOCATION> after mass protests in the city of El</LOCATION> Alto</LOCATION> -LRB- the poorest in the country -RRB- , with citizens complaining of unfair water charges . 
This forced the government to cancel the contract . 
In Argentina</LOCATION> , Suez 's subsidiary , which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water , has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government . 
During the last financial crisis in Argentina</LOCATION> , the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos , and then freezing them during devaluation , had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations . 
When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina</LOCATION> arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina</LOCATION> . 
But he has rejected any tariff increases , alleging this will impoverish citizens further . 
He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water . 
On May 2004 , Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos</LOCATION> Aires</LOCATION> water-concession contract . 
The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos . 
The issue has attracted European interest . 
Last week in Paris</LOCATION> , President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac . 
The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- to raise utilities tariffs , because most of the utilities operating in Argentina</LOCATION> are European .
