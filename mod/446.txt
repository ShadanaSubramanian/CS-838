US</LOCATION> in EU</LOCATION> tariff chaos trade row The US</LOCATION> has asked the World Trade Organisation to investigate European Union customs tariffs , which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade . 
The EU 's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act , the US Trade Representative 's Office said . 
Small and mid-sized US</LOCATION> firms were worst-hit , it added . 
The EU</LOCATION> expanded from 15 to 25 member states in May . 
The US</LOCATION> said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution . 
The move came in the same week that the US</LOCATION> and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US</LOCATION> firm Boeing . 
New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row , which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn . 
Explaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers , the US Trade Representative 's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue `` early in the EU 's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement '' . 
Ten countries , mostly in Eastern</LOCATION> Europe</LOCATION> , joined the EU</LOCATION> in May . 
The US</LOCATION> said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $ 155.2 bn -LRB- # 82.8 bn -RRB- in 2003 . 
`` Although the EU is a customs union , there is no single EU customs administration , '' a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick , US</LOCATION> Trade Representative , said . 
Lack of uniformity , coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US</LOCATION> exports , especially for small to mid-sized businesses '' , An EU spokesman in Washington</LOCATION> dismissed the US</LOCATION> complaint . 
`` We think the US</LOCATION> case is very weak . 
They have n't come up with any evidence that US</LOCATION> companies are being harmed , '' said Anthony Gooch . 
It could take several months for the WTO 's dispute settlement panel to report its findings .
