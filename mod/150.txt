Galloway plea for hostage release Ex-Labour MP George Galloway has appealed for the release of aid worker Margaret Hassan , kidnapped in Iraq</LOCATION> . 
Mrs Hassan , 59 , who led Care International operations in Iraq</LOCATION> , was abducted in Baghdad</LOCATION> on 19 October . 
Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour party because of his staunch opposition to the war on Iraq</LOCATION> . 
He denied an earlier report that he planned to make a direct appeal to the kidnappers via the Al-Jazeera Arabic television channel . 
Speaking in London</LOCATION> on Saturday at the first annual delegate conference of his newly-founded party , the Respect Coalition , he said : `` I have deliberately not involved myself before in any of these situations . 
`` But this woman has been a prominent opponent of both the war and the preceding years of sanctions . 
`` I am prepared to do anything I can to help save her life . '' 
A spokesman later said Mr Galloway had friends in common with Ms Hassan , who he described as a prominent anti-war activist , and that he was `` willing to do anything - go to Iraq</LOCATION> or be an intermediary or anything that 's necessary '' . 
Since her abduction , several videos of Mrs Hassan have been broadcast by Al-Jazeera . 
The latest footage showed Mrs Hassan asking for British troops to be pulled out of Iraq</LOCATION> . 
She also urged Care International , the aid agency she works for , to close its office in Baghdad</LOCATION> , and appealed for Iraqi women prisoners to be freed . 
Care has since closed down all its operations in Iraq</LOCATION> .
