Turkey-Iran mobile deal ` at risk ' Turkey</LOCATION> 's investment in Iran</LOCATION> 's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs . 
Iran</LOCATION> 's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell 's stake in a new mobile network from 70 % to 49 % . 
The move , which was justified on national security grounds , follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments . 
Turkcell said the decision `` increases the risks '' attached to the project . 
Although the company 's statement said it would continue to monitor developments , observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $ 3bn deal . 
`` The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero , '' said Atinc Ozkan , analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul</LOCATION> . 
If Turkcell does back out , MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running . 
The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran</LOCATION> will award it the mobile deal . 
Turkcell 's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran</LOCATION> to run into trouble . 
Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran</LOCATION> 's new Imam</LOCATION> Khomeini</LOCATION> International</LOCATION> Airport</LOCATION> - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004 . 
In both cases , the justification has been national security , amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel</LOCATION> . 
The hardline posture taken by parliament , which is dominated by religious conservatives , could yet impact other inward investments .
