GM , Ford cut output as sales fall US</LOCATION> car firms General Motors -LRB- GM -RRB- and Ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales . 
US</LOCATION> sales at GM sank 12.7 % in February compared to a year ago while Ford sales dropped 3 % as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market . 
Meanwhile , Asian carmakers fared well - Toyota sales jumped 11 % while rival Nissan notched up a 10 % increase . 
Overall . 
sales across the industry also fell to 1.25 million vehicles from 1.27 million a year earlier . 
GM and Ford blamed high fuel prices for low sales of big trucks and gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles -LRB- SUVs -RRB- - the vehicles that provide the biggest profits . 
GM added that US</LOCATION> truck sales fell 9 % in February while car business tumbled 17 % , however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the Pontiac</LOCATION> G6 and Chevrolet Cobalt - had put in solid performances . 
`` The calendar year is starting off slower than expected , both for GM and the industry , '' said Mark LaNeve , GM 's vice president for North American sales , service and marketing . 
The slump in sales prompted the group to cut production in North</LOCATION> America</LOCATION> by 3 % - it has already reduced output by around 9 % in the face of growing stockpiles . 
Meanwhile , Ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly US</LOCATION> sales , said it was cutting first-quarter North American production by another 10,000 vehicles , or 1.2 % . 
Chrysler , the US</LOCATION> unit of Germany</LOCATION> 's DaimlerChrysler , was the only Detroit</LOCATION> based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8 % . 
But America</LOCATION> 's loss was its foreign rivals ' gain as they continued to nibble away at the US</LOCATION> market . 
While Japan</LOCATION> 's top car maker Toyota and Nissan saw sales accelerate , even the smaller Suzuki Motor Corp snapped up a more business with sales improving 17.6 % on a year ago . 
In 2003 , the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple US</LOCATION> sales by 2007 as it seeks to become a bigger player in the Asian assault on the US</LOCATION> market . 
Korea</LOCATION> 's Hyundai was another big gainer , turning in a 19 % surge in February sales . 
Toyota put its rise in sales down to strong results for its redesigned Avalon sedan and a 120 % surge in sales of its gas-electric Prius hybrid mid-size sedan as petrol-price conscious consumers looked to vehicles that were cheaper to run . 
`` As gas prices continue their upward march , fuel efficiency catches the public eye , '' Jim Press , vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota 's US</LOCATION> sales arm , said in a statement .
