Tsunami ` wo n't divert Africa</LOCATION> aid ' UK</LOCATION> aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa</LOCATION> , Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised . 
Mr Blair told the BBC 's Breakfast with Frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not `` invade '' the money Britain</LOCATION> wanted to spend on Africa</LOCATION> . 
Questioned about the disaster , he said his faith in God had not been shaken . 
He added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related British deaths to the Commons on Monday . 
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Friday that about 440 Britons were either dead or missing in the disaster . 
Mr Blair told Sunday 's programme : `` Since Jack Straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they have n't moved a great deal , which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers . 
But we just ca n't be sure . 
`` It is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures , all countries are struggling with this . '' 
He said the # 50 million originally allocated from the Department for International Development was now `` well on the way '' to being spent . 
But the exact allocation could not be clarified until the World Bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected . 
Within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction , he added . 
But he pledged that Africa</LOCATION> - which sees a `` preventable '' tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict , disease and poverty - would not be neglected . 
As Britain</LOCATION> takes up its presidency of the G8 group of leading nations , Mr Blair said ministers had a big agenda for Africa</LOCATION> . 
`` For the first time we have a plan that wo n't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within African countries and conflict resolution , '' he said . 
`` A lot of the problems in Africa</LOCATION> come from conflict , that again are preventable , but only with the right systems in place . ''
