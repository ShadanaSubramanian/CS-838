BA to suspend two Saudi services British Airways is to halt its flights from London</LOCATION> Heathrow</LOCATION> to Jeddah</LOCATION> and Riyadh</LOCATION> in Saudi</LOCATION> Arabia</LOCATION> from 27 March . 
The airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services . 
BA currently operates four flights per week from Heathrow</LOCATION> to Jeddah</LOCATION> , and three weekly journeys to Riyadh</LOCATION> . 
It suspended flights to Saudi</LOCATION> Arabia</LOCATION> for three weeks in autumn 2003 after a government warning about a `` threat to UK</LOCATION> aviation interests in Saudi</LOCATION> Arabia</LOCATION> '' . 
BA will now suspend the Saudi flights - which it says will remain `` under constant review '' - from 27 March . 
`` The decision to suspend flights between the UK</LOCATION> and Saudi</LOCATION> Arabia</LOCATION> is a difficult one to make as we have enjoyed a long history of flying between the two countries , '' said BA director of commercial planning , Robert Boyle . 
`` However , the routes do n't currently make a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain them while this remains the case . '' 
Passengers with flights booked after the suspension date will be contacted by BA for alternative arrangements to be made .
