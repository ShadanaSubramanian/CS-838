India</LOCATION> unveils anti-poverty budget India</LOCATION> is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen . 
India</LOCATION> 's defence budget has also been raised 7.8 % to 830bn rupees -LRB- $ 19bn -RRB- . 
The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government 's Communist allies onside . 
But his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit , which he said would be 4.5 % of GDP in the year to March 2005 . 
The country 's overall deficit is thought to be more than 10 % , if the spending of India</LOCATION> 's 35 states and territories is included . 
Under the fiscal responsibility law , Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year , a target he says he has now met for the current year . 
But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3 % , Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law 's requirement . 
`` I was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act , '' he said . 
The following year , though , would have to be back on track , he warned . 
`` I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means , '' he said . 
The coming year 's reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India</LOCATION> 's burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system , although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget . 
Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament , Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in . 
He said India</LOCATION> 's economy grew 6.9 % in 2004 . 
In his budget Mr Chidambaram has : - Increased spending on primary education to 71.56 bn rupees -LRB- $ 1.6 bn -RRB- - Increased spending on health to 102.8 bn rupees -LRB- $ 2.35 bn -RRB- - Announced that 80bn rupees -LRB- $ 1.8 bn -RRB- will be spent on building rural infrastructure - Pledged 102.16 bn rupees -LRB- $ 2.3 bn -RRB- for tsunami victims - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30 % - Announced a package for the sugar industry In addition , up to 100bn rupees -LRB- $ 2.3 bn -RRB- to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country 's foreign exchange reserves , keeping budgeted spending under control . 
`` Given the resilience of the Indian economy ... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty , '' Mr Chidambaram said . 
`` The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty . '' 
The new Indian government , led by the Congress Party , was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a `` human face '' . 
The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India</LOCATION> 's tax system while expanding the tax base . 
As part of his reforms he has announced : - Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials - Expanded service tax net - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees -LRB- $ 2,300 -RRB- - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees -LRB- $ 5,700 -RRB- to 20 % - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30 % An annual economic survey released on Friday said India</LOCATION> needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment , reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth . 
But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending . 
The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will . 
In recent months , they have expressed their displeasure at the government 's economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation . 
In his last budget , Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers .
