US</LOCATION> company admits Benin</LOCATION> bribery A US</LOCATION> defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $ 28.5 m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin</LOCATION> . 
The Titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $ 2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kerekou . 
At the time , Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin</LOCATION> . 
There is no suggestion that Mr Kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing . 
Titan , a California-based company , pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US</LOCATION> anti-bribery laws . 
It agreed to pay $ 13m in criminal penalties , as well as $ 15.5 m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US</LOCATION> financial watchdog , the Securities and Exchange Commission -LRB- SEC -RRB- . 
The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $ 2.1 m to an unnamed agent in Benin</LOCATION> claiming ties with President Kerekou . 
Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election . 
Shortly after the poll , which Mr Kerekou won , Benin</LOCATION> officials agreed to quadruple Titan 's management fee . 
Prosecuting attorney Carol Lam said : `` All US</LOCATION> companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted . '' 
The company says it no longer tolerates such practices . 
Under the US</LOCATION> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials .
