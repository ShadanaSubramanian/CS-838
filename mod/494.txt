SEC to rethink post-Enron rules The US</LOCATION> stock market watchdog 's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US</LOCATION> corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms . 
In a speech at the London School of Economics , William Donaldson promised `` several initiatives '' . 
European firms have protested that US</LOCATION> laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly . 
The US</LOCATION> regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act . 
The Act comes into force in mid-2005 . 
It obliges all firms with US</LOCATION> stock market listings to make declarations , which , critics say , will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts . 
Firms that break the new law could face huge fines , while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years . 
Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms , the Securities and Exchange Commission -LRB- SEC -RRB- would `` continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements '' . 
There are few , if any , who disagree with the intentions of the Act , which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts . 
But European firms with secondary listings in New</LOCATION> York</LOCATION> have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing . 
The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US</LOCATION> shareholders , a situation many firms without US</LOCATION> listings could find themselves in . 
The 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy , a delisting . 
Mr Donaldson said the SEC would `` consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process '' for foreign firms unwilling to meet US</LOCATION> requirements . 
`` We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections '' without turning the US</LOCATION> market into `` one with no exit '' , he said . 
He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act 's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms . 
Seen as particularly costly to implement , Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm 's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts . 
The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US</LOCATION> ones - with market capitalisations below $ 700m -LRB- # 374m -RRB- . 
A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change , the Financial Times reported . 
It was led by Digby Jones , director general of the UK</LOCATION> 's Confederation of British Industry -LRB- CBI -RRB- and included representatives of BASF , Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes . 
Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US</LOCATION> listings . 
Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $ 1.07 bn -LRB- # 558m -RRB- stock market debut last month . 
There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New</LOCATION> York</LOCATION> later this year . 
Instead , the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong</LOCATION> Kong</LOCATION> , according to press reports in China</LOCATION> .
