Blair congratulates Bush on win Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president . 
Mr Bush 's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was `` fractured , divided and uncertain '' , Mr Blair said . 
It had to be brought together , he added , saying action was needed on poverty , the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> and the conditions on which terrorists prey . 
Mr Blair said states had to work with the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to fight global terrorism . 
But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by `` military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values '' he added . 
Solving the conflict in the <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> was the world 's single most `` pressing political challenge '' of the present day , Mr Blair warned . 
The prime minister also urged <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> to `` build anew their alliance '' . 
`` All of us in positions of leadership , not just President Bush , have a responsibility to rise to this challenge . 
It is urgent that we do so . '' 
Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry 's campaign , saying he had helped make the presidential election `` a true celebration of American democracy '' . 
The election of the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> president was significant for the world but particularly so for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> because of its special relationship , he added . 
Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his `` warmest congratulations '' , saying : `` We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom . '' 
Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election , unlike in 2000 . 
Mr Bush 's first task was to `` rebuild a sense of domestic purpose '' within the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> , he said . 
Mr Kennedy said : `` Internationally , it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies , not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism . '' 
Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start , adding it was almost as if there was an `` umbilical cord '' between Mr Bush and the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> premier . 
`` Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character , and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security . 
`` <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come . '' 
Even before the result became clear , Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won . 
Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday . 
Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> will act on global warming despite George Bush 's refusal to sign up to the <LOCATION>Kyoto</LOCATION> protocol on carbon emissions . 
Public opinion would force change , she told BBC news . 
But Myron Ebell , an adviser on climate change to President Bush , has said there would be no change in the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> stance and rejected the threat of climate change . 
He claimed the <LOCATION>US</LOCATION> was the only country with independent scientists .
