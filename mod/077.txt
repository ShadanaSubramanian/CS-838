China</LOCATION> had role in Yukos split-up China</LOCATION> lent Russia</LOCATION> $ 6bn -LRB- # 3.2 bn -RRB- to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas</LOCATION> unit of oil group Yukos , it has been revealed . 
The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $ 6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk</LOCATION> in turn came from Chinese banks . 
The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China</LOCATION> . 
The deal sees Rosneft receive $ 6bn in credits from China</LOCATION> 's CNPC . 
According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti , these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk</LOCATION> . 
Reports said CNPC had been offered 20 % of Yugansk</LOCATION> in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead . 
Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos , Yugansk</LOCATION> 's former owner , if CNPC had become a shareholder . 
Rosneft and VEB declined to comment . 
`` The two companies -LSB- Rosneft and CNPC -RSB- have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries , '' said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan . 
`` There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years . '' 
The announcements help to explain how Rosneft , a medium-sized , indebted , and relatively unknown firm , was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk</LOCATION> . 
Yugansk</LOCATION> was sold for $ 9.3 bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $ 27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines . 
The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US</LOCATION> court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm . 
But Yugansk</LOCATION> was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft . 
Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
Once the country 's richest man , Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion . 
The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China</LOCATION> 's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy . 
China</LOCATION> 's thirst for products such as crude oil , copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels . 
`` Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage -LSB- in Russia</LOCATION> -RSB- , '' said Dmitry Lukashov , an analyst at brokerage Aton . 
`` They understand property rights in Russia</LOCATION> are not the most important rights , and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies . '' 
`` If the price of oil is fixed under the deal , which is unlikely , it could be very profitable for the Chinese , '' Mr Lukashov continued . 
`` And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash , so it 's a good deal for them too . ''
