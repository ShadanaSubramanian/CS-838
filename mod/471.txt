Tsunami slows Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> 's growth Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> 's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $ 3.5 bn -LRB- # 1.8 bn -RRB- by appealing for peace and national unity . 
President Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict . 
Meanwhile , the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> 's economic growth this year . 
It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5 % of the economy . 
Separately , the International Labour Organisation -LRB- ILO -RRB- said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> and Indonesia</LOCATION> alone . 
It called for action to create jobs . 
President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota</LOCATION> . 
She was joined by government and opposition politicians , together with Buddhist , Hindu , Muslim and Christian clergy . 
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami . 
Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be `` the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation '' . 
`` We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully . 
Instead we have been squabbling , fighting , '' she added . 
Norway</LOCATION> 's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers , who want a separate state in the north east of the country . 
Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> have been hampered by tensions between the two sides . 
The IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities ' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $ 1.3 to $ 1.5 bn , but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this . 
`` The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage , '' the IMF said . 
Growth , inflation , the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs . 
`` The fishing industry has been devastated , agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer , especially in the short term , '' the report said . 
The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs , mostly in these three industries . 
Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15 % lower than last year . 
Economic growth this year is expected to be 4 % , which is about 1 % less than previously forecast . 
Inflation could climb to 14 % compared to a previous estimate of 12 % . 
Although major exports have not suffered , the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments . 
Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as `` Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level '' which totalled more than two months worth of imports . 
Last week , the IMF approved Sri</LOCATION> Lanka</LOCATION> 's request for a freeze on loan repayments .
