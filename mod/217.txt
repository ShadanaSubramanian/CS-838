Ukraine</LOCATION> trims privatisation check Ukraine</LOCATION> is to review `` dozens '' of state asset sales as the country 's new administration tackles corruption . 
The figure announced by President Viktor Yushchenko is less than the 3,000 cases mentioned last week , but will cover many of the biggest deals . 
Ukraine</LOCATION> recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links . 
In a separate statement , the EU said that the US</LOCATION> should back Ukraine</LOCATION> 's entry into the World Trade Organisation . 
The comments came as Viktor Yushchenko prepared to head to Brussels</LOCATION> to meet with US</LOCATION> President George W Bush and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation -LRB- Nato -RRB- leaders . 
He is the only non-Nato member leader invited to attend the summit . 
Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls , and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine</LOCATION> more transparent . 
Earlier this month , new Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight . 
Her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves . 
`` We acknowledge that business in Ukraine</LOCATION> is now shaped and 98 % of privatisations were carried out according to the law , '' Mr Yushchenko said on Monday . 
`` We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law , '' he continued , adding that any review would focus on `` dozens of companies , not hundreds or thousands '' . 
He cited last year 's sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns . 
It was sold in June 2004 to a consortium that included Viktor Pinchuk , son-in-law of former-President Kuchma , and Rinat Akhmetov , the country 's richest man , for $ 800m -LRB- # 424m -RRB- - despite other higher offers . 
Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine</LOCATION> was taking , fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with Brussels</LOCATION> . 
He said that while he understood that Ukraine</LOCATION> was not ready for EU membership , the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements . 
`` We deserve an honest response , '' Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview . 
`` We understand the difficulties . 
We refuse to understand double standards . '' 
Ukraine</LOCATION> may find it has a sympathetic ear in Brussels</LOCATION> `` The EU has reiterated that we support -LRB- Ukraine</LOCATION> 's -RRB- fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year , '' said Claude Veron-Reville , a spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson . 
`` We have said as much to the Americans . 
We feel that it is important for us all to pull together for Ukraine</LOCATION> to be allowed into the WTO . 
Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia</LOCATION> , which borders the country to the east , saying it was important to maintain ` pragmatic ' ties with Moscow</LOCATION> . 
`` Russia</LOCATION> is Ukraine</LOCATION> 's eternal strategic partner , '' Mr Yushchenko said .
