<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> plays down Varig rescue The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country 's biggest airline . 
<LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig , <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's flagship airline . 
However , the country 's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution . 
Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais -LRB- $ 2.3 bn or # 1.2 bn -RRB- . 
Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country 's Congress to discuss the airline 's crisis , Mr Alencar replied : `` No , I do n't think so . 
We will see . '' 
Earlier , Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week . 
`` In practice , it will be an intervention , although this is not the technical name used '' , he said . 
An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances . 
For that to happen Varig 's main shareholder , the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline 's employees , would have to be removed , Mr Wilson said . 
However , no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying , he added . 
Varig , which operates in 18 countries apart from <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> , has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country 's economic downturn . 
The depreciation of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 's currency has had a direct impact on the airline 's dollar debt as well as some of its costs . 
Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy . 
The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government . 
On Tuesday the courts awarded Varig 2bn reais -LRB- $ 725m -RRB- , after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992 . 
But the government can appeal the decision .
