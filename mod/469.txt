In return for the funding , Turkey</LOCATION> would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms . 
Turkey</LOCATION> 's economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001 . 
Economic growth has average 6-7 % in the past three years , ahead of IMF forecasts , while inflation fell below 10 % this year for the first time in 30 years . 
However , Turkey</LOCATION> has a huge debt burden - already owing $ 23bn to the IMF - while its current account deficit has swelled to $ 10.7 bn this year . 
The Turkish economics minister , Ali Babacan , said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program . 
Rodrigo de Rato , the IMF 's managing director , said the loan agreement would help to improve Turkish economic prospects by cutting its debt and stimulating growth .

The agreement must still be ratified by IMF directors at a meeting expected to take place next month . 
The agreement would also enable Turkey</LOCATION> to defer payments on previous loans worth $ 3.7 m until 2006 . 
As part of the draft agreement , Turkey</LOCATION> has signed a `` letter of intent '' stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector .
