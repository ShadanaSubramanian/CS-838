Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq Shares in UK</LOCATION> drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France</LOCATION> 's Pernod Ricard . 
Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid , but has yet to contact its target . 
Allied Domecq shares in London</LOCATION> rose 4 % by 1200 GMT , while Pernod</LOCATION> shares in Paris</LOCATION> slipped 1.2 % . 
Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics . 
Pernod 's last major purchase was a third of US</LOCATION> giant Seagram in 2000 , the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms . 
The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo . 
In terms of market value , Pernod</LOCATION> - at 7.5 bn euros -LRB- $ 9.7 bn -RRB- - is about 9 % smaller than Allied Domecq , which has a capitalisation of # 5.7 bn -LRB- $ 10.7 bn ; 8.2 bn euros -RRB- . 
Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie , one of Scotland</LOCATION> 's premier whisky firms , but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH . 
Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky , Havana Club rum and Jacob 's Creek</LOCATION> wine . 
Allied Domecq 's big names include Malibu</LOCATION> rum , Courvoisier brandy , Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine 's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream . 
The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation , having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio . 
Pernod</LOCATION> has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8 bn euros , while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains .
