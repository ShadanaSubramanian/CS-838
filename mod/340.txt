Venezuela</LOCATION> and China</LOCATION> sign oil deal Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has offered China</LOCATION> wide-ranging access to the country 's oil reserves . 
The offer , made as part of a trade deal between the two countries , will allow China</LOCATION> to operate oil fields in Venezuela</LOCATION> and invest in new refineries . 
Venezuela</LOCATION> has also offered to supply 120,000 barrels of fuel oil a month to China</LOCATION> . 
Venezuela</LOCATION> - the world 's fifth largest oil exporter - sells about 60 % of its output to the United</LOCATION> States</LOCATION> . 
Mr Chavez 's administration , which has a strained relationship with the US</LOCATION> , is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market . 
China</LOCATION> 's quick-growing economy 's need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year , along with political unrest in the Middle</LOCATION> East</LOCATION> and supply bottlenecks . 
Oil prices are finishing the year roughly 30 % higher than they were in January 2004 . 
In 2004 , according to forecasts from the Ministry of Commerce , China</LOCATION> 's oil imports will be 110m tons , up 21 % on the previous year . 
China</LOCATION> has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990 's with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad . 
A lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the Middle</LOCATION> East</LOCATION> has meant that China</LOCATION> is looking to invest in other potential markets such as Latin</LOCATION> America</LOCATION> . 
Mr Chavez , who is visiting China</LOCATION> , said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of China</LOCATION> . 
Chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of Venezuela</LOCATION> , which could produce more than one billion barrels , he confirmed . 
The two countries will also continue a joint venture agreement to produce stocks of the boiler fuel orimulsion . 
Mr Chavez has also invited Chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western Gulf of Venezuela</LOCATION> . 
The two countries also signed a number of other agreements covering other industries including mining .
